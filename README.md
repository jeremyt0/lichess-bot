# lichess-bot
Created a bot to automatically make a move against an online friend on lichess.com.

The bot emulates a user playing chess on the browser.

It uses computer vision from OpenCV libraries to detect new moves and updates the Stockfish engine.

A return move is generated and imitates a user click on the calculated squares.
